# AfterworldSMP
Afterworld SMP is a survival server where a group of players find themselves in a strange new world with no explanation. What happens next is shaped entirely by how they choose to survive, who they trust, and the roles they play. It’s a slow-burn story told through gameplay, alliances, and conflict.
